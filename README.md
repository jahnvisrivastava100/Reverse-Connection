# Reverse-Connection <br>
Connect to any device throughout the world <br>
We can connect to  device of friend/victim's anytime using 2 methods<br>
1)Direct Connection<br>
2)Reverse Connection<br>

Here we make use of reverse connection to connect to friend/victim's device.<br>

<b> Reason for avoiding direct connection ? </b><br>
since we know IP addresses are of two types  dynamic and static<br>
and our routers give us Dynamic IP <br>
Our friends/victims IP address will keep on changing with each restart<br>
To avoid this problem we can make use of reverse connection<br>
where instead of setting connection from our device to their's we set up connection from their side<br>
by sending a python client side script which when runs on friend/victim's computer may give complete access to the their cmd<br>
which will allow us to run CMD command on their device<br>
