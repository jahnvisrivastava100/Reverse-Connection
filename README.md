# Reverse-Connection <br>
Connect to any device throughout the world <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can connect to  device of friend/victim's anytime using 2 methods
<br>
<br>
1)Direct Connection<br>
2)Reverse Connection<br>
<br>
<br>
Here we make use of reverse connection to connect to friend/victim's device.<br>

<b> Reason for avoiding direct connection ? </b><br>
since we know IP addresses are of two types 
1)dynamic  2) static<br> **Note: our routers give us Dynamic IP <br>**
<br>
* Our friends/victims IP address will keep on changing with each restart<br>
* To avoid this problem we can make use of reverse connection<br>
* where instead of setting connection from our device to friend/victims's we set up connection from friend/victims's side<br>
* we do this by sending a python client side script which when runs on friend/victim's computer may give complete access to the their cmd<br> **[One can explore DDE attacks for sending such stuff in case of victim]**
* which will allow us to run CMD command on their device<br>
